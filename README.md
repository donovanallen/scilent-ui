## Design Guidelines

Read more about the design philosophy and guidelines behind Scilent UI [here](https://github.com/donovanallen/scilent-ui/blob/main/DESIGN.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js v23 or higher
- pnpm v10 or higher

## Getting Started

### Using NVM (recommended)

This project uses [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

```bash
# Install the correct Node.js version
nvm install
nvm use

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run Storybook
pnpm storybook
```

### Component Development with Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing and documenting components in isolation. Storybook provides a great way to visualize different states of your components and develop them interactively.

```bash
# Start Storybook
pnpm storybook

# Build Storybook for static deployment
pnpm build-storybook
```

Storybook is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which provides:

- Extremely fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- Native ES modules support
- Optimized build performance
- Built-in support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more

Each component in the library has:

- A `.stories.tsx` file that defines various states and variants
- A `.mdx` file for comprehensive documentation
- Auto-generated API documentation from TypeScript types and JSDoc comments

To view the Storybook documentation locally, run `pnpm storybook` and open your browser to http://localhost:6006.

### Project Structure

This is a monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. The packages are organized as follows:

- `packages/core`: Core components and utilities
- `packages/icons`: Icon components
- `packages/themes`: Theme definitions and utilities

### Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and publish packages.

```bash
# Create a new changeset
pnpm changeset

# Version packages based on changesets
pnpm version-packages

# Publish packages
pnpm release
```
