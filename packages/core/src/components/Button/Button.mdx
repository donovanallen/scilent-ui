# Button

The Button component is a fundamental UI element for triggering actions in your music application.

## Overview

Buttons communicate actions that users can take and are typically placed throughout your UI in forms, dialogs, and more.

### Primary

The primary button is used for the main action on a page or in a form.

### Secondary

Secondary buttons are used for secondary actions that are less important than the primary action.

### Outline

- Use secondary buttons for alternative actions
- Limit the number of primary buttons on a page to avoid confusion
- Use consistent button sizes within the same context
- Provide clear and concise button labels
- Consider using icons alongside text for better visual cues

## Accessibility

- Buttons are keyboard accessible and can be activated with the Enter or Space key
- When using icons without text, provide an aria-label for screen readers
