# Timestamp

The Timestamp component is a versatile tool for displaying time-related information in various formats, making it ideal for music applications.

## Overview

Timestamps are essential in music applications for displaying track durations, release dates, playback progress, and more. This component provides a unified way to handle all time-related displays with consistent styling and behavior.

## Props

<Controls />

## Use Cases

### Track Durations

Display track lengths in MM:SS format (or HH:MM:SS for longer content).

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.TrackDuration} />

For longer content like podcasts or albums, hours are automatically included:

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.LongDuration} />

### Relative Times

Show how long ago content was released, updated, or played.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.RelativeTime} />

### Dates and Times

Display formatted dates for album releases, event dates, etc.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.FormattedDate} />

Display formatted times:

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.FormattedTime} />

Combined date and time:

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.FormattedDateTime} />

### Custom Formatting

For specialized needs, you can use custom formatting options:

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.CustomFormat} />

## Variants

### Default

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.TrackDuration} />

### Muted

For less emphasis, such as secondary information.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.MutedVariant} />

### Highlight

For emphasizing important time information.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.HighlightVariant} />

### Contrast

For use on dark backgrounds.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.ContrastVariant} />

## Sizes

### Small

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.SmallSize} />

### Medium (Default)

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.TrackDuration} />

### Large

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.LargeSize} />

## Features

### Animated Changes

The component can animate value changes for a smoother user experience, particularly useful for playback timers.

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.AnimatedChanges} />

### Auto-updating

Relative timestamps can automatically update to stay current:

```jsx
// This will update automatically every minute
<Timestamp value={releaseDate} format="relative" autoUpdate={true} />
```

### Internationalization

The component supports different locales for proper internationalization:

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.DifferentLocales} />

## Real-world Examples

### Album Release Date

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.AlbumReleaseDate} />

### Current Playback Time

<Canvas of={TimestampStories.PlaybackTime} />

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `duration` format for track lengths, playback progress, and other time durations
- Use `relative` format for showing how long ago something happened
- Use `date` formats for release dates and scheduled events
- Consider using the `muted` variant for secondary time information
- Use `animate` for values that change frequently, like playback timers
- Enable `autoUpdate` for relative times that should stay current

## Accessibility

- The component uses semantic HTML elements
- Time information is presented in a clear, readable format
- For screen readers, the component renders as a semantic `<span>` element
